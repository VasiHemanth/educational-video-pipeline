    "title": "Generative AI Interview Q3001: Dynamic RAG @ Scale w/ Vertex AI #Shorts",
    "description": "Designing a highly scalable and dynamic RAG system on Google Cloud involves integrating Vertex AI's Vector Search for efficient retrieval of relevant information from a continuously updated knowledge base stored in Google Cloud Storage. Eventarc and Pub/Sub orchestrate real-time data ingestion, triggering Cloud Run services that utilize Document AI and text-embedding-004 to process and embed new data for Vector Search. Gemini 1.5, operating in High-Fidelity Mode, then leverages the retrieved context to generate precise responses with in-line citations, enabling Multimodal RAG capabilities. This architecture ensures rapid query processing for millions of users while maintaining data freshness and contextual accuracy. Master this complex architecture and accelerate your career.
