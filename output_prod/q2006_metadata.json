    "description": "Dive into building a highly scalable and cost-effective serverless Generative AI application on GCP using RAG. This video explains an architecture where Cloud Functions trigger Dataflow pipelines to process data into Vector Search, enabling Vertex AI (Gemini) to perform efficient RAG. Cloud Run hosts the core application, while Cloud Storage manages data. Cloud Build ensures CI/CD, all monitored and logged by Cloud Monitoring and Logging. Master GCP's serverless power for GenAI!
