    "description": "Discover how to architect a hyper-scalable RAG system on Google Cloud. This technical deep-dive explores a robust workflow: Document AI ingests data from Cloud Storage, then Vertex AI Embeddings API vectors are indexed in Vertex AI Vector Search for hybrid retrieval, optimized with Context Caching. Cloud Run orchestrates queries via Vertex AI Agent Engine, leveraging Gemini for generative responses with sub-100ms latency. BigQuery aids metadata filtering, while VPC Service Controls, IAM, and Vertex AI Safety Filters ensure enterprise-grade security. Elevate your system design skills; watch now for a deep dive into high-performance RAG!",
