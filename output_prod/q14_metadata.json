    "description": "Design a real-time ETL pipeline on GCP for high-volume IoT streaming data. Pub/Sub ingests raw streams, feeding into Cloud Dataflow jobs leveraging Apache Beam. Dataflow, enhanced by Streaming Engine and Dataflow Shuffle, processes and transforms data efficiently. Refined data is then loaded into BigQuery via the Storage Write API, optimized for low-latency analytics. Cloud Monitoring ensures observability, while Flex Templates streamline deployment and Cloud Composer orchestrates complex workflows. This architecture guarantees scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient data processing. Master GCP ETL design. Hit like & subscribe for more expert insights!",
