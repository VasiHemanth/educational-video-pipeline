    "description": "Master GCP serverless architecture! Learn to design a highly scalable and cost-effective system for image processing. User-uploaded images land in Cloud Storage, triggering an Eventarc event that publishes to Cloud Pub/Sub. This event then invokes Cloud Functions for real-time resizing and watermarking. For more complex, custom image analysis, Cloud Run microservices can be orchestrated. Finally, all processed image metadata is robustly stored in Firestore. Build resilient, auto-scaling solutions now! #GCP #Serverless #CloudArchitecture",
