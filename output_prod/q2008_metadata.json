    "title": "GCP Interview Q2008: Real-time Analytics: Event-Driven Serverless Pipeline #Shorts",
    "description": "Dive into designing a highly scalable, event-driven data processing pipeline on GCP for real-time analytics, leveraging serverless components. Data ingress is managed by Pub/Sub, acting as a robust message broker, with Cloud Functions triggering on new messages to process initial events or Cloud Run instances handling more complex data transformations. Workflows orchestrate multi-step processes, persisting state in Firestore, while processed data lands in Cloud Storage for long-term retention and further analysis. Sensitive configurations are securely fetched from Secret Manager, and comprehensive monitoring with Cloud Logging and Cloud Trace ensures operational visibility, all governed by fine-grained IAM policies. This architecture ensures seamless, decoupled interactions between services, allowing independent scaling and resilience essential for real-time demands. Master GCP serverless architecture with this in-depth guide!",
