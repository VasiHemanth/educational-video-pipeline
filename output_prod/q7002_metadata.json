    "description": "Design a hyper-scalable, event-driven GCP architecture for millions of IoT sensor readings/sec. Eventarc Advanced triggers Pub/Sub, reliably ingesting data streams. Cloud Run or Cloud Functions process events serverlessly, scaling dynamically based on message volume. Workflows orchestrate complex tasks, storing raw data in Cloud Storage before efficient ingestion into BigQuery for analytics. Memorystore caches critical processing data for low-latency access, all secured by robust IAM policies. Master serverless IoT on GCP today!",
