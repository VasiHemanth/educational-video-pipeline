    "description": "Architecting a large-scale Generative AI application for a Fortune 500 demands a robust framework. This video details an architectural workflow leveraging a Cloud AI Platform to host LLMs, integrated with proprietary data via RAG using Vector Databases. Kubernetes ensures scalable deployment, while MLOps pipelines automate continuous integration and delivery. Observability tools provide real-time performance insights, complemented by Model Monitoring for drift detection and Data Governance for compliance. Master these concepts to build and deploy ethically sound, high-performing Gen AI solutions. Learn more about enterprise AI architecture today!",
