    "description": "Learn to design a scalable Generative AI search solution on Google Cloud Platform. Data is ingested into Cloud Storage or BigQuery, processed by Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, and transformed into embeddings via Vertex AI's LLMs. These embeddings are stored and efficiently retrieved using Matching Engine for vector search. LangChain orchestrates the entire RAG workflow, connecting diverse data sources to robust LLM responses. This architecture ensures high performance and scalability for complex Gen AI applications. Master these principles to excel in your next Cloud Architect interview!",
