    "description": "Establishing robust Model Governance and Compliance for Generative AI on GCP involves a multi-faceted framework. Vertex AI and Model Registry manage model lifecycle, while Cloud DLP ensures sensitive data protection throughout the pipeline. IAM and Cloud Audit Logs provide granular access control and immutable activity tracking, creating an auditable trail for regulatory adherence. AI Workbench facilitates secure development environments, and Data Catalog aids in discovery and classification of AI-related assets. Security Command Center offers centralized vulnerability management, and Generative AI APIs integrate secure AI capabilities. Implement these services to achieve comprehensive data privacy, ethical AI practices, and regulatory compliance, solidifying your Gen AI operations on GCP.
