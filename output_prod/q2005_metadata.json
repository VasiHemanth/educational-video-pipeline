    "description": "Design a highly scalable, cost-effective, and fault-tolerant serverless pipeline on Google Cloud Platform to process millions of IoT device sensor data in real-time. Incoming data is ingested via Pub/Sub, triggering real-time analytics with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, before being stored in BigQuery for powerful insights. This architecture leverages Eventarc for seamless service orchestration and integrates Cloud Monitoring and Logging for robust observability. Master these GCP services for your next cloud architect interview. Learn more now!",
