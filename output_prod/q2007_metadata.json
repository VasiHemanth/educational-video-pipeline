    "title": "GCP Interview Q2007: Serverless Image Processing Pipeline Explained! #Shorts",
    "description": "Designing a serverless image processing pipeline on GCP starts with users uploading content to Cloud Storage, which triggers a Cloud Pub/Sub notification. This event activates a Cloud Function, responsible for processing the image, potentially using the Cloud Vision API for analysis, and storing metadata in Firestore. Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging provide crucial observability throughout the workflow, ensuring operational health. Finally, processed images are served efficiently via Cloud CDN. Master this architecture to build highly scalable, cost-effective, and robust image handling solutions on Google Cloud. Level up your GCP interview game!",
